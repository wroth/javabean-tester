JavaBeanTester -- Charles Roth's fork from Rob Dawson's original.
2014-11-28

JavaBeanTester is a stand-alone utility class that automatically tests
the getter and setter methods for simple Java beans.

There is an ongoing (if admittedly small) controversy over whether 
one should write unit-tests for Java beans.  Writing such tests
is often seen as a waste of time, or even 'gaming' code coverage.
Yet beans are simple (if tedious) to test, and they can break, if
only due to cut-and-paste errors.

By providing a very simple, quick, and automatic way to write
such tests, JavaBeanTester eliminates the debate.  Since it is
trivial to use, take the 10 seconds to write the test call, and
be done already(!) :-)

This fork of Rob Dawnson's original provides:

  1. A full Eclipse project with working code examples,
     that should make it easier to see how to use JavaBeanTester.

  2. Some minor changes to the JavaBeanTester class itself,
     that allow for re-use across multiple projects, integration
     with EasyMock, and additional standard classes (List's
     and Map's) that the code "knows about".  (See the class header
     comments for more details.)

  3. This README!

According to Rob, the original code was released under the MIT license.
All of Charles' changes are likewise released under the same license.
